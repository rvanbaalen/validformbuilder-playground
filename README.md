# ValidForm Builder Playground
An easy to use playground to get your hands dirty with ValidForm Builder

## Install

Run `composer install` from the project root

## Get started

Run `open http://localhost:8000 && php -S localhost:8000 -t public/` to get started. This will start a basic webserver on `localhost:8000`

## Requirements

You need to have `composer` and `yarn`* installed on your development machine.

**Yarn serves as a faster alternative for `npm`*
