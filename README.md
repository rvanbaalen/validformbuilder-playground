# ValidForm Builder Playground
An easy to use playground to get your hands dirty with ValidForm Builder

## Installation

### Local usage
Clone the repository and run `composer install` from the project root. This will install all dependencies, 
trigger a `yarn install` and open your web browser once everything is done.

### Docker
If you have Docker for Desktop installed, you can pull the `validformbuilder/playground` image from the 
Docker Hub to immediately browse through all of the example code.

Just use `docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 --name vfb-playground validformbuilder/playground`

## Get started

Run `open http://localhost:8000 && php -S localhost:8000 -t public/` to get started. This will start a 
basic webserver on `localhost:8000`

## Requirements

### Local
You need to have `composer` and `yarn`* installed on your development machine.
On a Mac, this can be easily installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh): `brew install php@7.3 composer yarn`

### Docker
If you prefer using the docker image, make sure you have 
[Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your local machine.
